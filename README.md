# Personal Projects

Welcome! These are a few coding projects I've worked on in my spare time. Feel free to browse, take inspiration, or copy any part of the code that you find useful.

Enjoy exploring!

## Projects
- a simulation of an oscilator that gets hit by a bullet with respect to collison time
- a furier transform of a periodic circle looking function
- a simple coluring book picture maker proably has been done before
- probably some other stuff that I forgot
